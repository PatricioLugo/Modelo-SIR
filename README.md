# Modelo-SIR
Visualization of the COVID pandemic using different versions of a SIR model.

This project uses R, implementing statistical concepts such as discrete and continous variables to model the behaviour of COVID-19 and integrates the results in an expositional shiny app. Lastly, a combination of HTML and CSS was used for aesthetics.

**Note:** The files that have www in their name are intended to be saved in a folder named "www", in order for the visuals to run properly.
